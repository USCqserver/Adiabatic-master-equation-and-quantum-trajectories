# Adiabatic-master-equation-and-quantum-trajectories
Code of adiabatic master equation and quantum trajectories used in paper
These are the codes of adiabatic master equation (ame.m) and quantum trajectories (aqt.m) used in paper:
https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.022116

The Hamiltonian is a 8-qubit ferromagnetic Ising spin chain in a transverse field, with annealing schedule attached as 'DW1_parameters.txt'. This relatively complex problem illustrates a lot of subtle points in the implementation of ame and aqt, and can be easily reduced to smaller and simpler problems.

The master equation is:

Both ame.m and aqt.m use sparse matrix for computation. aqt.m uses parallel computation.
